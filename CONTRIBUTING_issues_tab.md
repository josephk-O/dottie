# Using the Issues Tab

The issues tab is where new issues are posted. 

To understand what peers are working on, make sure you have read the [Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/pulls) first.

# How to open a new issue

if you spot an issue please open in the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/issues)

- please add labels! üè∑Ô∏è This helps newcomers in particular understand the codebase
- ensure issues are labelled with either `must have`, `should have` or `nice to have`

# Using a template vs. making a note

There are 2 Templates available

- Bug Report
- Feature Request

These are both formal templates with guidelines

Altneratively, if you'd prefer to take time to collect your thoughts and don't yet have a formal acceptance criteria, you can include `(Draft)` in the title.

# Leaving comments on the issues

- Leaving comments on issues is primarily used for discussion and clarification.
- You can leave a comment like `I'm on this`. Just be aware primarily we use Draft Pull Requests to self-assign.
- If a peer has left such a comment with no Draft Pull Request, the issue can be considered as open. Use common sense.
